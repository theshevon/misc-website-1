Cryptography doesn't always have to involve difficult maths and algebra*. Sometimes it can just be simple algorithms that make for fun puzzles! This workshop, we'll be going over the basics of symmetric cryptography. We'll introduce stream ciphers and block ciphers and see a couple of interesting scenarios where they may be vulnerable, with some live demos putting our theory to practice and solving some puzzles! As usual, the workshop will be online on Discord. Join here https://discord.gg/JmXrDF7 if you haven't already!

*If you are interested in the more formal side of cryptography, stay tuned for our guest lecture next week by Eleanor who will be presenting a talk on Cryptographic Security (details to come)!

Join us this week as we take a look at two different types of file upload vulnerabilities and how to exploit them, along with some bypasses for common filters. We'll also look at a recent CVE featuring these techniques. There'll be a simple CTF challenge at the end!

As usual, the workshop will be held on Discord. Join here if you haven't already https://discord.gg/JmXrDF7

See you there!

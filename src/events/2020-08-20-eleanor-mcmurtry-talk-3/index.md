When most people hear "cryptography", they think of encryption algorithms, and if they're a little familiar with computer science possibly digital signature algorithms. But this is only scratching the surface of what cryptography can do for us! In this talk, Eleanor will introduce you to zero-knowledge proofs: methods to prove you know a secret without revealing anything about that secret. It sounds impossible, like a magic trick... but it can be done, and it's one of the biggest areas of cryptography research right now. Applications for zero-knowledge proofs include auctions, elections, digital currency, and many more.

The talk will be livestreamed from Eleanor's Twitch.tv (https://www.twitch.tv/ellierigby)

Ever entered junk data into websites in hopes of hacking in? Ever felt disheartened that it didn't work?
Join us this week as we go explore the wonderful world of Blind SQL Injections. Learn how to query and understand a database, in order to become one with the system. Master the ultimate game of True or False, and ruin a bad database manager's day (or career)*. Then celebrate with some deliciously free pizza and coke energy.

_*legally and ethically of course_

Note: This workshop will start at 2:15pm and run until 4pm as opposed to the usual 1:15pm-3pm!

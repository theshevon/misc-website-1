This week, we'll be learning about exploiting Linux user privileges. In particular we will be looking at ssh and abusing sudo configurations with a live demo on solving a challenge. 

1) This workshop is beginner friendly 
2) Kali Linux is not required, but recommended. Its easier to work if everyone is on a similar system
3) Be sure to have some sort of Unix based OS installed (iOS is fine) or a client with ssh like PuTTy.

NB: Pizza will be provided.

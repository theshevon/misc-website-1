This week, we have a very special workshop run by Adam Kues. Adam is a CTF veteran and was part of the team that secured 4th position in CySCA 2018. 
He will be going over vulnerabilities in binaries at the application level. Don't worry if you don't know what that means, as it is geared towards newbies. 

This workshop comes with its own bespoke set of challenges designed by Adam specifically for MISC.

Turn up for your usual weekly pizza with an extra topping of exclusive challenges.

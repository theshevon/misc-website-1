Hello folks! Hope you had a wonderful winter holiday and are feeling ready to go in Semester 2. What better way to kick off the semester than going back to the basics. In this workshop, we will explore the wonderful world of Linux. We’ll see what we can achieve with this mighty tool.
This workshop is targeted towards beginner and intermediate users of Linux to take their OS skills to the next level. We’ll cover a wide range of basic commands and get hands-on practice as well.
For this workshop, we recommend having a free TryHackMe (https://tryhackme.com/) account registered and ready to go. It’s best if you can set the VPN ready for TryHackMe (https://tryhackme.com/room/openvpn)
Time: Thursday 5 August, 4pm to 5pm AEST

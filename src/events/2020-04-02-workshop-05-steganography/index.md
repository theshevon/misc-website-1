We continue our social distancing life with more online workshops from MISC! This week, we will take a look at the basics of steganography: the art of hiding secrets from others in plain sight. Steganography is easier than you think, and this workshop will go over some tools (both online and offline) that you can use no matter what computer (or toaster) you have. Unleash your problem and puzzle solving skills, with practice challenges for you to work on!
Come participate in this workshop by joining the discord (if you haven't already): https://discord.gg/JmXrDF7 this Thursday 6:30PM!

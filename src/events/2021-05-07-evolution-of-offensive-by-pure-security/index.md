We are collaborating with our amazing sponsor Pure Security to bring you an exclusive event exploring the offensive security landscape. Our guest speaker, Arni Hardarson, who is the Head of Technical Assurance at Pure Security will be walking us through how hackers and offensive security technology has evolved. Arni will also go through the history of offensive hacking and how it has evolved from days when hacking was all about gaining access to PBX systems in the 1980s to getting paid $1m for a weaponised exploit to fully take over your iPhone and everything in between.

This will be a great opportunity for students to learn more about the industry as well as to make some resourceful industry connections.

And yes, there will be free Pizza and Pure Security merch giveaways for the attendees. The event is open to everyone :D

Guest Speaker: Arni Hardarson Head of Technical Assurance Date & Time: 7th May, 12pm â€“ 1pm AEDT

Location: TBD (On Campus)

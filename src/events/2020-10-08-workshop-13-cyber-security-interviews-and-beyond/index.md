We hope you're all enjoying the break! 

This week, our very own Kaif Ahsan, incoming security engineer intern at Atlassian, will talk about the ins and outs of the interview process for security roles, including specific formats and example questions from particular companies. He'll also talk about internships, grad roles and key insights that have helped him through many successful applications and interviews in the industry!

As usual, it will be delivered over Discord. https://discord.gg/JmXrDF7

See you there!

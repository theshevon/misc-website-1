This week, we will be hosting Ryan Kelly. Ryan is a Senior Staff Software Engineer at Mozilla and he will be talking to us about his experience in the industry - most notably, his team discovering code injection using emojis! 

Come along to get a feel for what working at Mozilla is like, and to see what it's like working in the industry.

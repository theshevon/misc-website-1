Join us this week as we dive deep into the core fundamentals of being a penetration tester. 
We will be focusing mainly on:
- Leveraging vulnerabilities to access machines remotely
- Methodologies a pentester (i.e you) can use once you have gained access.

Also pizza will be provided. Due to the limited amount, each member will receive slices proportional to the number of lectures they have attended (new UMSU policy)

Hi all, 

This week, Kaif will be giving us an overview of network protocol analysis! This will involve sniffing network traffic and analysing what's going on over the wire. Kaif will introduce us to Wireshark and Netcat, both of which will be extremely valuable to know how to use for the future. 

We will be using the Wireshark tool to learn how to analyse network traffic. It comes pre-installed in Kali, but if you don't have Kali yet, we strongly recommend you to install it. Not to worry if you can't/don't want to, though! You can also just download Wireshark onto your device. A link to Wireshark is here: https://www.wireshark.org/download.html 

Once again, there will be !!!pizza!!! so make sure to bring all your friends. Look forward to seeing you there!

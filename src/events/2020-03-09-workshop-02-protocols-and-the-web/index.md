Everyone uses the Internet, but not everyone understands how it works. Understanding the architecture behind websites and applications on the Internet is the first step to attacking them.

Join us this week as we go under the hood (under the wire?) to learn how the web works and dive into the details of HTTP requests. We'll explore some cool tools that we can use to modify our requests and create connections to other devices on the Internet. Then we'll look at some other protocols and see how we can do some shady stuff (for educational purposes only, of course). With a solid understanding of how things work, we'll go through some Capture-The-Flag challenges and you'll be well on your way to becoming a 1337 h4x0r!

Needless to say, there will be free pizza for all!
